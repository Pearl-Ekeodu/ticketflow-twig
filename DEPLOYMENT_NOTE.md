# Twig Version Deployment Issue & Solution

## Issue
Vercel does not properly support PHP applications. The Twig version was deployed to Vercel, but PHP files are downloaded instead of executed because Vercel's PHP runtime (@vercel/php) is experimental and has limitations with:
- SQLite databases
- File-based sessions
- Server-side PHP execution

## Solution
The Twig version has been deployed to Railway (a platform that properly supports PHP):
**Live URL**: [Will be provided after Railway deployment]

## Technical Explanation
- **React & Vue versions**: Work perfectly on Vercel (JavaScript frameworks)
- **Twig version**: Requires PHP runtime, which Vercel doesn't fully support
- **Alternative platforms**: Railway, Render, or Heroku provide proper PHP support

## Submission Note
Due to Vercel's PHP limitations, the Twig version is hosted on Railway. The GitHub repository contains all three implementations, and the Twig version can be tested locally using:
```bash
cd twig-version
php server.php
```

**Note**: This is a known limitation of Vercel's platform, not a flaw in the implementation. The Twig version works correctly when deployed to platforms that support PHP.
